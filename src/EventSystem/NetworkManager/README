# Array type
Do not pass non-contiguous arrays to invocation methods. It breaks the length operator.

# Creating a new built in data type
The creation of a new data type is handled by DataTypes:AddType.
Special types (such as array and record) should have their own encode/decode signature.
All data are defined in the DataTypes folder, and loaded by the NetworkManager module.
(Thanks for still not having a way to have a script run on both client and servers)

## DataType ID
Every built in should have it's own unique ID.
This allows it to be correctly identified in a buffer without using a string to reference it.
> Named identifiers must also be unique.
> This also goes for user defined types.

## DataType size
DataTypes that do not have fixed size (such as arrays) should set their size to 0.
For fixed size data types, the size should represent the size of data structure in bytes.

## DataType type name
This is the name of the Lua(u)/Roblox data type as returned by the typeof function.

# Limits
Only 255 unique data types may exist.
Some of these slots are taken by the built in data types.
