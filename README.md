EventSystem is a framework for handling various different types of events that you would see in games.

A list of features include:
- Custom Event class
- A easy to use input system
- UI events, allowing you to treat even frames as a button.
- Custom cursor's, providing more consistent cursor behavior and multi-gamepad support.

# Plans

Switch to deferred events for InputActionSystem which will also allow you to accurately check other action's values.

Remove the old UICursor file.

Continue development after finishing ExtendedMath.
